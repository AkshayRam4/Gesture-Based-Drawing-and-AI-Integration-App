This interactive Streamlit app uses a webcam and hand gesture detection to enable real-time drawing on a virtual canvas. 
It recognises gestures (e.g., index finger for drawing, thumb for clearing) and integrates AI to process drawings for tasks like problem-solving.

**Features**
1) Gesture-based drawing with real-time webcam input.
2) Virtual canvas interaction.
3) AI integration for analysing drawings (planned).
